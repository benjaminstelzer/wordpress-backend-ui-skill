# WordPress 7.0 and 7.1 source contracts

Revalidate a source when its trigger applies. Keep documented APIs, observed
implementation, and Skill-Norms distinct.

## Pinned WordPress 7.0 repository state

## WordPress 7.1 theming contract

Revalidated 2026-09-03. The 7.0 package restrictions above remain scoped to
their pins, not to all WordPress 7 releases.

- `WordPress/WordPress` tag `7.1` resolved to
  `b998fef9238af183f9523b3df71618e6e57498b6`. Its
  [script-loader.php](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress/blob/b998fef9238af183f9523b3df71618e6e57498b6/wp-includes/script-loader.php)
  registers the `wp-theme` style handle with the Core design-token stylesheet.
- `@wordpress/theme` 1.0.0 was published at Gutenberg commit
  `7fe6fa42d4cf9cdd084223e3150f796567914f87`. Its
  [theme runtime entry](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/blob/7fe6fa42d4cf9cdd084223e3150f796567914f87/packages/theme/src/index.ts)
  publicly exports `ThemeProvider`. Its pinned README and implementation own
  the 7.1 prop and wrapper contract.
- The [7.1 Dev Note](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2026/07/31/design-system-theming-in-wordpress-7-1/)
  documents plugin use of the Core stylesheet, direct semantic tokens for
  plugin-specific CSS, and the separate public JavaScript provider.
- The [package reference](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-theme/)
  documents stylesheet ownership, scoped theming, and the distinction between
  inside-WordPress and standalone applications. It is a moving reference, not
  proof that every currently documented prop exists in every 7.x release.

The stable 7.1 tag and inspected local 7.1 Core agree on style registration, semantic gap and
padding tokens, and the public JavaScript export. This is source evidence,
not proof of enqueue or visual correctness on a customer page. The retained
7.0 fixture and its frozen package graph are not a 7.1 rendered test.

See [version-compatibility.md](version-compatibility.md) for the executable
enqueue example and verification boundary. Recheck the actual supported Core
release, built exports, token names, and document whenever the target changes.

Observed selectors are compatibility evidence, not automatically supported
public extension APIs. When a source changes, update the fact label first, then
re-evaluate the derived Skill-Norm. Never silently preserve a stale number or
experimental contract.
