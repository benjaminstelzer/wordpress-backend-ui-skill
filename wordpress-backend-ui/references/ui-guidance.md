# User guidance, navigation, forms, and states

Use WordPress conventions to make the primary task, current location, next
action, state, and recovery understandable without implementation knowledge.

## Task and hierarchy

Identify the primary task, required prior information, one primary action for
the current decision region, secondary or progressive information, states, and
available recovery. Visual difference must represent a real difference in
meaning or interaction. Avoid decorative cards or emphasis.

Use exactly one primary page title. Heading levels follow content hierarchy, not
desired visual size.

## Navigation

- Put one small settings or tool page under Settings or Tools.
- Use a top-level menu only for a distinct, frequently used, multi-page product
  area. Provide consistent local navigation and expose the current item.
- Do not duplicate the Core admin menu with ornamental navigation.
- A page-title action is appropriate only when it is understandable before the
  main content. Form submission usually follows its fields.

Classic page header order:

```html
<div class="wrap">
  <h1>...</h1>
  <hr class="wp-header-end">
  <!-- Core moves non-inline page notices here. -->
</div>
```

## Actions

- Use one primary action per decision region.
- Name an action by its actual result. Use the same object term in the action,
  status, success, and error.
- Name the object and consequence for destructive actions. Confirm actions that
  are consequential and not easily undone. Offer undo only when restoration is
  real.
- A disabled action needs a nearby, programmatically associated reason.
- During loading, prevent accidental duplicate submission while preserving
  action context and predictable focus.

## Forms

- Use persistent visible labels. Placeholder text is not the only label or
  instruction.
- Help text explains format, consequence, or a non-obvious choice instead of
  repeating the label.
- Communicate requiredness and constraints before avoidable failure.
- Use fieldset/legend or the owning WordPress group component.
- Keep errors near fields and add a summary only when it helps locate multiple
  errors. Preserve entered values when safe.
- Do not solve localized layout problems by shortening or fragmenting copy.

## Feedback

### Classic

- Use `add_settings_error()` and `settings_errors()` where applicable.
- Page Notices remain movable so Core places them after `.wp-header-end`.
- Field/component messages stay at their source and use `.inline` when Core
  notice styling is suitable. Do not use deprecated `.below-h2`.

### React

- Use `Notice` for persistent, important, actionable, error, warning, or
  page-level information.
- Use `Snackbar` only for low-priority short-lived confirmation when the result
  remains discoverable elsewhere.
- Expose asynchronous state programmatically without moving focus unless the
  interaction requires it.

## State requirements

| State | Required guidance |
| --- | --- |
| Initial | Primary task, values, prerequisites, and action are clear. |
| Loading | Name what changes, prevent duplicate action, preserve orientation, announce status. |
| Partial | Distinguish available results from missing parts, preserve usable results, name what is incomplete, and offer only real retry or continuation. |
| Empty | Explain what is absent and offer one valid next action if available. |
| Success | State what changed with persistence proportional to consequence. |
| Error | State the user-relevant problem and an available next action. Do not promise unsupported retry. |
| Disabled | Explain why and what requirement enables the action. |
| Permission | Explain unavailable access without sensitive detail, make impossible actions consistent, provide a safe return. |

Include only states possible in the flow, but cover every state introduced by
the implementation.

## Accessibility

- WCAG 2.2 AA is the default floor.
- Preserve keyboard operation, logical focus order, visible and unobscured
  focus, names, roles, values, labels, descriptions, error association, and
  status announcements.
- Visible control text appears in its accessible name, preferably at the start.
  Icon-only controls use purpose-based names.
- Reuse Core/component contrast and focus behavior. A necessary custom color
  requires measured WCAG AA evidence.
- Never rely on color, position, shape, hover, or motion alone.
- Pointer targets meet `24 x 24 CSS px` or a documented WCAG exception.
